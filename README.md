## About

This is a fork of [Arcaniax's Builder's Utilities][arcaniax-bu] with
customizable messages and nicer-looking GUIs. Be aware that the two plugins do
not function exactly the same; they differ greatly in some areas.

## What's different?

- Every message is easily configurable and uses [MiniMessage][MiniMessage] syntax.
- World interactions respect PlotSquared and WorldGuard restrictions.
- Both the permissions and the commands have been completely redone. (See the
  [plugin.yml][plugin.yml] for an updated list!)
- All the GUIs have been revamped. Everything looks and feels a lot nicer.

In addition to that, everything has been polished and reviewed, rigorously, by
me, over a couple sleepless nights. Now *that's* what I call quality code.
